# Part 0 â€“ Exercises 0.1 to 0.3

## 0.1: HTML

This exercise asked me to read about the basics of HTML.  
I learned that HTML is used to define the structure and content of web pages using elements like `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, and tags like `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<a>`, and many others.

## 0.2: CSS

In this part, I read about the basics of CSS.  
CSS is used to style HTML elements, including colors, fonts, layout, spacing, etc.  
There are different ways to apply CSS: inline, internal `<style>`, or external stylesheets (`<link rel="stylesheet">`).

## 0.3: HTML forms

I reviewed how HTML forms work.  
A form is created using the `<form>` element, and it usually contains input fields like `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<button>`, and labels.  
When submitted, a form can send user data to a server via an HTTP request (usually POST or GET).

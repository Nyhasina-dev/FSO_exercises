# Phonebook Backend - Deployment Status

This repository contains the backend for the Phonebook application developed as part of the Full Stack Open course.

## Deployment Readiness

The backend is fully prepared and configured to be deployed on cloud platforms such as Render or Fly.io.

It uses environment variables (e.g., `PORT`) for configuration and serves the frontend statically from the `dist/` directory.

## Deployment Status

**Due to the absence of a credit card, I was unable to deploy the backend to any cloud service at this time.**

However, the project is production-ready and can be deployed at any moment once a payment method is available.

## Running the Backend Locally

To run and test the backend on your local machine:

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
